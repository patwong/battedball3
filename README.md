# battedball3
testing python math libs with 2016 mlb batted ball data (python3 version)

uses python's numpy, scipy, plotly, and mpld3 libraries

battedball.py is the parser and a script in main() that sends data to the plotter. bbp2 uses the mpld3 libary, bbp3 uses plotly.

# what it does
some interactive plots to visualize players' batted ball performance. using data from FanGraphs and Baseball Savant (MLB.com)

# plots
- "barrels/PA" versus average hitting speed scatterplot, [link](https://patwong.github.io/bb/brlpa_ahs.html)
- (maximum hit speed and average hit speed differential) versus batting average (inspiration from jeff sullivan), [link](https://patwong.github.io/bb/max_bb_ahs_ba.html)
- all graphs can be found on my project page [here!!](https://patwong.github.io/bb_project_page.html)
