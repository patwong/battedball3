	-

2016.12.19
- added cleanfiles() to remove pickle files and playersnotindict.txt (useful to repopulate the dictionaries)
	source: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5532498/delete-files-with-python-through-os-shell
- added subset of FanGraphs' leaderboard stats to pdict
- implementing mpld3 scatter plot in bbp2.py
	- using interactive tooltips
		- invisible points over the existing points to allow two colors to coexist (alpha=0)
		source: http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html
			http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30686157/python-matplotlib-invisible-point
	- fixed appended lists
		lists are appended with "+" operator

2016.12.20
- using plot.ly instead of mpld3

2016.12.21
- abstracted away some plotting features in bbp3.plotter features, i.e. the main script specifies the stats to plot on the x/y-axes
- checking type of item (useful for xmin/max values)
	source: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4541155/check-if-a-number-is-int-or-float
- setting random xmin value by popping item from dictionary
	source: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4859292/how-to-get-a-random-value-in-python-dictionary
- formatted rvalue by getting sigdigs of a float
	source: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html

2016.12.22
- updated README and project webpage
	- published three graphs (mpld3, plotly x2)

2016.12.23
- created axesdict - dictionary that maps player keys to their full string value
- bbp3:
	- added a check to see if x or y-values are allowed to be 0
	- separating histogram and scatter plot codes
		- include a if-statement to see what kind of plot is desired
		- overriding "yax" for histogram to include bin label stats
	- trying to label histogram bins but ?????????

2017.01.09
- pushed the initializing/parsing routines to a class
- moved "main" to a testscript (class_test_script.py)


2017.01.11
- moved scatter to separate function of class module
- moved histogram to separate function of class module
	- using pandas to sort list/array
		- instead of manually binning them, using pandas dataframe "cut" command to add attribute
			- bins are manually determined
		source: http://chrisalbon.com/python/pandas_binning_data.html
		- use pandas to count the number of elements with desired "x-val", get the columns average "y-val"
			- i.e. x-val of avg hit speed => binning by AHS, y-val of wRC+ => get each column's average wRC+
		- use statsdict's total player number to get frequency by percentage rather than by discrete value
	- using plotly to have hoverable info tips

2017.01.12
- finished hist
	- using bar graph over histogram
		- built-in histogram lacks useful tooltips
	- pandas:
		- used to determine max/min value of a column
		- with dataframe, can count the values of a given dataframe's column
			- dataframe is a matrix with nonhomogeneous values
		- use dataframe's cut to bin the values
		- when grouping similar values in a column using value_count, the return value is a pd.Series, not dataframe
			- reconstructed dataframe is in pandaframe2, original dataframe is pandaframe1
	- removed legacy 'hist' from code
- how to pandas' cut: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.cut.html

2017.01.13
- added some examples to class_testscript.py with comments
- cleaned out some legacy code and comments

2017.01.17
- moved legacy code to "old" directory

2017.03.24
- parsing functions are now private
- parsing functions placed in 'private' section - bottom of bb3class.py
- renamed bb3class.py to battedball.py
	- filename available after the deprecated version was moved to 'old/'
- added '__doc__' to user-available functions
	- hist(), cleanfiles(), scatter()
- cleanfiles() now calls __init__()
	- previously, __init__() was called manually after auxiliary files were removed; very unsafe!
- added a few more comments to class_testscript.py to explain usage
- renamed class_testscript.py to test_script.py
- updated README.md


[to add]
- correct free agent list at the start of the offseason (Kendrys Morales, Mitch Moreland not FA in source list)
- convert files into a class
	- allows for base constructor to create the dictionaries based on given input, rather than doing it in the main() script - done 01.09
	- add plotters to class	- done 01.12
- generalized plot function, e.g. submit a lambda function to do the math, with other various inputs for x/ylabels, title, legend, more
	- can specify any x and y from using existing stats in the dictionary, but cannot preprocess data yet
- additional safety checks in method calls (2017.03.24)
- output list of stats available to user, as input to hist() and scatter()
